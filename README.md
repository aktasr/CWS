Crypto currency exchanges WebSocket Library

This is a generic cryptocurrency exchange websocket library.
You can obtain data which is same formatted for all exchanges from websocket. So that, you don't deal with the structure complexity. 
(Each exchanges sends data on its own data structure format.)

Simple use, just call instance by giving specific subscribe parameters, f.e: subscribe orderbook for BTCUSDT. Then start to use parsed or raw data syncronously or asyncronously, whatever you want.

Supported functions:
orderbook
ticker
trade

Supported Cryptocurrency Exchanges:
BTCTURK

BINANCE will be added.

Please let me know if this helps you.
